\section{Conclusion}\label{con}
We have presented an MPC acceleration engine that is tightly coupled to an ARM processor embedded on the same chip. Our acceleration engine has been designed to allow trading off between performance and hardware resource usage. Our tight interface with an on-chip ARM processor allows software to easily update the configuration of the acceleration engine to control a wide range of systems, and to adjust the desired system trajectory at run-time. An avenue of future work is examining the architectural details required for interfacing and managing external sensors to extend our evaluation from controlling a real-time Plant on Chip to actual physical systems, such as quadcopters.
